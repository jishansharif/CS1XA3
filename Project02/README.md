## Overview
This Webpage is Jishan Sharif's Portfolio/Custom CV.
I have designed this webpage to show my interest towards software engineering
and backend development. 


## Custom JavaScript Code
1)I tried to keep my webpage as simple as possible. In my opinion, Adding 
animations is informal when it comes to deigning a professional Portfolio. 
However, I have added a feature which allows the user to click a 'button' and 
the *position of the text will change*. This was done by initializing the 
button element. 

*<button onclick="myMove()">Jishan Sharif</button>*

myMove is the name of the function and onclick enables the user to click on a
certain text which in this case is "Jishan Sharif" 
Using conditional statements, I defined a function frame to shift the text in 
it's original position when the pixel reaches 150. 

2) Added a **fade** feature to my images using *data AOS* AOS is declared to 
have a slide as well as a fade effect.

was from stack overflow and w3schools.
